# Assigning Certificate Renewal Permissions to ACM<a name="PcaPermissions"></a>

With [Managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/managed-renewal.html) in AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\), you can automate the certificate renewal process across both public and private certificate authorities\. In order for ACM to automatically renew the certificates generated by a private CA, the ACM service principal must be given all possible permission *by the CA itself*\. If these renewal permissions are not given to ACM, the CA's owner \(or an authorized representative\) must manually renew each private certificate\.

Renewal permissions can be delegated during [private CA creation](PcaCreateCa.md) or altered anytime after as long as the CA is in the `ACTIVE` state\.

You can manage private CA permissions from the [ACM Private CA Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca), the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the [ACM Private CA API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/):

**To assign private CA permissions \(console\)**

1. Sign in to your AWS account and open the ACM Private CA console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/acm\-pca/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/home)\.

1. Choose **Private CAs**\.

1. Choose your private CA from the list\.

1. Choose the **Permission** tab\.

1. Select **Authorize ACM to use this CA for renewals**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

**To manage permissions in ACM Private CA \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [create\-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/create-permission.html) command to assign permissions to ACM\. You must assign all possible permissions \(`IssueCertificate`, `GetCertificate`, and `ListPermissions`\) in order for ACM to automatically renew your certificates\.

```
aws acm-pca create-permission \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
--actions IssueCertificate, GetCertificate, ListPermissions \
--principal acm.amazonaws.com
```

Use the [list\-permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/list-permissions.html) command to list the permissions delegated by a CA\.

```
aws acm-pca list-permissions \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/123455678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

Use the [delete\-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/delete-permission.html) command to revoke permissions assigned by a CA to an AWS service principal\.

```
aws acm-pca delete-permission \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
--principal acm.amazonaws.com
```
