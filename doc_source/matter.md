# Using the Matter standard<a name="matter"></a>

The [Matter connectivity standard](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) specifies certificate configurations that improve the security and consistency of internet of things \(IoT\) devices\. Java samples for creating Matter\-compliant root CA, intermediate CA, and end\-entity certificates can be found at [Using the AWS Private CA API to implement the Matter standard \(Java examples\)](API-CBR-intro.md)\.

To assist with troubleshooting, the Matter developers provide a certificate verification tool called [chip\-cert](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/src/tools/chip-cert)\. Errors that the tool reports are listed in the following table with remediations\.


****  

| Error code | Meaning | Remediation | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  0x00000305   |  `BasicConstraints`, `KeyUsage`, and `ExtensionKeyUsage` extensions must be marked critical\.  | Ensure that you have selected the correct template for your use case\. | 
|  0x00000050  |  The authority key identifier extension must be present\.  | AWS Private CA does not set the authority key identifier extension on root certificates\. You must generate a Base64\-encoded AuthorityKeyIdentifier value using the CSR and then pass it through a [CustomExtension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CustomExtension.html)\. For more information, see [Activate a Matter\-compliant root CA](JavaApiCBC-ActivateRootCA.md) and [Activate a product attestation authority](JavaApiCBC-ProductAttestationAuthorityActivation.md)\. | 
| 0x0000004E | Certificate is expired\. | Ensure that the certificate you use is unexpired\. | 
| 0x00000014 | Certificate chain validation failure\. |  This error may be encountered if you attempt to create a Matter\-compliant end\-entity certificate without using the provided [Java examples](API-CBR-intro.md), which use the AWS Private CA API to pass a properly configured KeyUsage\.  By default, AWS Private CA generates nine\-bit KeyUsage extension values, with the ninth bit resulting in an extra byte\. Matter ignores the extra byte during format conversions, causing chain\-validation failures\. However, a [CustomExtension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CustomExtension.html) in the `APIPassthrough` template can be used to set the exact number of bytes in the `KeyUsage` value\. For an example, see [Create a node operating certificate](JavaApiCBC-NodeOperatingCertificate.md)\. If you modify the sample code or use an alternative X\.509 utility such as openssl, you need to perform manual verification in order to avoid chain validation errors\.
