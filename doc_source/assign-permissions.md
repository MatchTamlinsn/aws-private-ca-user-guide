# Create Single\-Account Permissions for an IAM User<a name="assign-permissions"></a>

When the CA administrator \(that is, the owner of the CA\) and the certificate issuer reside in a single AWS account, a best practice is to separate the issuer and administrator roles by creating an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user with limited permissions\. For information about using IAM with ACM Private CA, along with example permissions, see [Understanding Resources, Ownership, and Permissions Policies](security-iam.md#understand-resource-ownership)\.

**Single\-Account Case 1: Issuing an unmanaged certificate**  
In this case, the account owner creates a private CA, and then creates an IAM user with permission to issue certificates signed by the private CA\. The IAM user issues a certificate using the ACM Private CA `IssueCertificate` API\.

![\[Issuing an unmanaged certificate\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/images/ca_access_1_account_pca_api.png)

Certificates issued in this manner are unmanaged, which means that an administrator must export them and install them on devices where they are intended to be used\. They also must be manually renewed when they expire\. Issuing a certificate using this API requires a certificate signing request \(CSR\) and key pair generated outside of ACM Private CA by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) or a similar program\. For more information, see the `IssueCertificate` [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_IssueCertificate.html)\.

**Single\-Account Case 2: Issuing a managed certificate through ACM**  
This second case involves APIs from both ACM and PCA\. The account owner creates a private CA and IAM user as before, and then [grants permission](PcaCreateCa.md#configure-acm-renewal) to the ACM service principal to renew automatically any certificates signed by this CA\. The IAM user again issues the certificate, but this time using the ACM `RequestCertificate` API, which handles CSR and key generation\. When the certificates expires, ACM automates the renewal workflow\.

![\[Issuing a managed certificate\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/images/ca_access_1_account_acm_api.png)

The account owner has the option of granting renewal permission through the management console during or after CA creation, or using the PCA `CreatePermission` API\. The managed certificates created from this workflow are available for use on with AWS services that are integrated with ACM\.

The following section contains procedures for granting renewal permissions\.

## Assign Certificate Renewal Permissions to ACM<a name="PcaPermissions"></a>

With [managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/managed-renewal.html) in AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\), you can automate the certificate renewal process for both public and private certificates\. In order for ACM to automatically renew the certificates generated by a private CA, the ACM service principal must be given all possible permissions *by the CA itself*\. If these renewal permissions are not present for ACM, the CA's owner \(or an authorized representative\) must manually reissue each private certificate when it expires\.

**Important**  
These procedures for assigning renewal permissions apply only when the CA owner and the certificate issuer reside in the same AWS account\. For cross\-account scenarios, see [Attach a Policy for Cross\-Account Access](pca-ram.md)\.

Renewal permissions can be delegated during [private CA creation](PcaCreateCa.md) or altered anytime after as long as the CA is in the `ACTIVE` state\.

You can manage private CA permissions from the [ACM Private CA Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca), the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the [ACM Private CA API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/):

**To assign private CA permissions to ACM \(console\)**

1. Sign in to your AWS account and open the ACM Private CA console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/acm\-pca/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/home)\.

1. Choose **Private CAs**\.

1. Choose your private CA from the list\.

1. Choose the **Permission** tab\.

1. Select **Authorize ACM to use this CA for renewals**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

**To manage ACM permissions in ACM Private CA \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [create\-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/create-permission.html) command to assign permissions to ACM\. You must assign the necessary permissions \(`IssueCertificate`, `GetCertificate`, and `ListPermissions`\) in order for ACM to automatically renew your certificates\.

```
aws acm-pca create-permission \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
--actions IssueCertificate GetCertificate ListPermissions \
--principal acm.amazonaws.com
```

Use the [list\-permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/list-permissions.html) command to list the permissions delegated by a CA\.

```
aws acm-pca list-permissions \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/123455678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

Use the [delete\-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/acm-pca/delete-permission.html) command to revoke permissions assigned by a CA to an AWS service principal\.

```
aws acm-pca delete-permission \
--certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:\
certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
--principal acm.amazonaws.com
```
